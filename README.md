# Joomla CMS Distributions

This is the Joomla CMS Distributions project.
One of the goals on the [Joomla CMS Roadmap](http://developer.joomla.org/cms/roadmap.html) is to create distributions for CMS packages.
This repository contains all the information you will need for getting involved in this project.
