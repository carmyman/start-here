# Joomla CMS Distributions

This is the Joomla CMS Distributions project.
One of the goals on the [Joomla CMS Roadmap](http://developer.joomla.org/cms/roadmap.html) is to create distributions for CMS packages.
This repository contains all the information you will need for getting involved in this project.

## Things to do

Things that need to be discussed, decisions that need to be made or problems that need to be addressed can be found in the [Issues](https://github.com/joomla-cms/start-here/issues) area of this repository.

## Getting involved

We are still working that out. See previous heading.
