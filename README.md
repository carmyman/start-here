This is the Joomla CMS Distributions project.
One of the goals on the [Joomla CMS Roadmap](http://developer.joomla.org/cms/roadmap.html) is to create distributions for CMS packages.
This repository contains all the information you will need for getting involved in this project.

* Active (and past) discussions can be found in the [issues](https://github.com/joomla-cms/start-here/issues) list.
* The [wiki](https://github.com/joomla-cms/start-here/wiki) will be the point of truth for policies and decisions that have been made, as well as a wealth of supporting information about this project.

## Getting involved

It's easy because everything happens here. Have a look at the
